Components of microservices architecture :
------------------------------------------

There are many component of MA, few are below :
1 : API Gateway - An entry point for client requests that routes requests to the appropriate microservices, performs authentication and authorization, and handles other tasks such as caching and request-response mapping.

2 : Service Discovery - A service registry that helps services locate and communicate with each other.

3 : Load Balancer - A component that distributes incoming requests to the appropriate service instances.

4 : Service Registry - A database of all available microservices, their endpoints, and metadata.

5 : Circuit Breaker - A mechanism that helps prevent cascading failures by interrupting communication between services when one service is not responding.

6 : Service Monitoring - A system that tracks the health and performance of microservices and generates alerts in case of failures or performance degradation.

7 : Service Orchestration - A layer that coordinates communication and interactions between microservices to ensure that they work together correctly.

8 : Configuration Server - A centralized repository for storing configuration information that is accessible to all microservices.

Advantages : 
------------------------------------------
1- Scalability improvements
2- Improved fault isolation
3- Program language and technology agnostic
4- Easy to deploy
5- Easy to test
6- Improved data security
7- Independent deployment

------------------------------------------
Disadvantages :
------------------------------------------
1- Need Integration testing
2- Increase complexity
3- Difficult to manage
4- Requires do load balancing and fix network latency

------------------------------------------
Micro-services design pattern :
------------------------------------------
Listing here, some popular micro-services design pattern :
1 : Service Registry pattern
2 : circuit breaker pattern
3 : API Gateway pattern
4 : Event driven architecture
5 : Database design pattern (1- database per service 2- shared database)
6 : CQRS
7 : Saga Pattern (1- Orchestrater, 2- Choreography)
8 : Two phase commit
9 : Externalized configuration
10 : Backend for frontend
11 : Bulkhead pattern
12 : Composite etc

------------------------------------------
micro-services principle or 12-factor app :
------------------------------------------
1 : Codebase
2 : Dependencies
3 : Config
4 : Backing services
5 : Build, release, run
6 : Processes
7 : Port binding
8 : Concurrency
9 : Disposability  ==> stop and start
10 : Dev/prod parity
11 : Logs
12 : Admin processes

------------------------------------------
How to implement :
------------------------------------------
Just think about that how many services are you going to create.(it depends on your project).
Example :
you can create two micro-services :
1- user service
2- department service

OR

1- Employee service
2- Employee management service etc.
----------------
Steps :
----------------
Go to spring initializer
1- choose language (java)
2- Build tool (maven)
3- Provide details of service (artifact, groupId, description etc)
4- Add dependencies :
	web starter
	jpa starter
	slf4j or lombok
	H2 or mysql database
5- export & import in code editor.

same way create another service.

=> Till here, we have only two micro-services that is okay. We can manage, easily do communication between them etc but lets assume
	there are 100 or 500 services then 
	-> How will you manage them?
	-> How to know each services port, url, status etc.
In this case it will become little  bit complex to manage and handle them.
Here, Service registry will come into the picture.

We will create service & will register all other services to it.
1- Create service & give name as service registry .
2- Add Eureka server (spring.cloud.netflix.eureka.server) dependency
3- export & import in code editor.
4- Goto main class where you have written main method & enable service registy by adding annotation
	@EnableEurekaServer
5- Since it will act as a server. Hence add below dependency in application.properties or applcation.yaml file :
	1- Add server.port=8761 (by default port)
	2- eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
	   eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
		
Question : How to register all services to service registry?
Answer : Add below things in all other services : 
			
			1 : Add below dependencies in POM 
				Eureka cloud & Eureka client descovery
				<dependency>
					<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
					<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
				</dependency>
				<spring-cloud.version>2022.0.2</spring-cloud.version>
				OR
				<spring-cloud.version>Hoxton.SR3</spring-cloud.version>
			2 : Goto main class where you have written main method & enable service registy by adding annotation
				@EnableEurekaClient or @EnableDiscoveryClient
			3 : Add below property in yaml file : 
				eureka:
					client:
						register-with-eureka:true
						fetch-registry:true
						server-url:
							default-zone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
					instance:
						hostname: localhost

-> You can also add applciation name in yaml.
-> Now run service registry & hit above url, You will see registered services here.

Here, request directly coming to the micro-services & they are doing communication that is okay. But what if there are multiple services and
	making request to service then how to handle it?

Here ApiGateway will come in to the picture.
All the request coming from the user will not go directly to specific service instead of this all request will hit api gateway and it's api
	Gateway responsibility to do route to specific service and get back the result.

-> To implement ApiGateway :
1 : Create a service name as api Gateway.
2 : Add Eureka discovery cleint  dependency.
3 : Add gateway dependency.
4 : Add @EnableEurekaClient in main class where you have written main method. 
5 : Add below prop
