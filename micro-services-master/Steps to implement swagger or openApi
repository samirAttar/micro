Get started with OpenApi.
THe library supports below :
1 : OpenAPI 3
2 : Spring-boot v3 (Java 17 & Jakarta EE 9)
3 : JSR-303, specifically for @NotNull, @Min, @Max, and @Size.
4 : Swagger-ui
5 : OAuth 2
6 : GraalVM native images

Lots of changes has been done in spring boot 3 and Swagger.
Note : Hence If you are using spring boot v3+ then add below open api dependency :
Question : How to choose which dependency should I use :
-> springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-api if they depend on spring-boot-starter-web and they only need the access to the OpenAPI endpoints.
-> OR springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui, if they depend on spring-boot-starter-web and they also need the access to the swagger-ui.
<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
		<artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
		<version>2.2.0</version>
</dependency>

- if you will run the program it will give you some exception and the is :
jakarta.validation.NoProviderFoundException: Unable to create a Configuration, because no Jakarta Bean Validation provider could be found. Add a provider like Hibernate Validator (RI) to your classpath.

Note : Below spring v3 and swagger v2, it will work fine.

Let's fix this issue, In order to fix this issue you should add validation dependency in your parent pom :
<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
</dependency>

-> Now, Good to go !! run application and smile😊.
-> Hit below url to access swagger-ui
	http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
-> For postman, select Get and then hit below url :
	http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

-> in both cases you will see json docs and some explaination about api.
-> If you will add/delete/update any record from swagger-ui then it will also reflect in H2 database.

------------------------
	Openapi Features
------------------------
1 : Adding API information and security documents
	For better performance of documentation generation, create config class or add below annotation in main class where you have written main method.
	1-@OpenAPIDefinitation (infor, servers, security, tags, extentions, externalDocs)
	2-@SecurityScheme (Security)
-> You can add below information to make it so beautiful along wit @OpenAPIDefinitation.
	@OpenAPIDefinition(info = 
	@Info(
	contact = @Contact(name = "Sufiyan", 
	email = "abc@gmail.com", 
	url = "http://localhost:8080/cruds"), 
	description = "OpenApi documentaion for spring boot crud apps", 
	title = "OpenApi specification - Sufiyan", 
	version = "1.0", 
	license = @License(
	name = "Licence name",
	url = "http://localhost:808/"), 
	termsOfService = "Terms of service declare here"), 
	servers = {
		@Server(description = "Local env", url = "http://localhost:808/"),
		@Server(description = "Prod env", url = "http://localhost:808/") })
		
->	you can also add security here but it depends on your requirement. If you want to apply same security to all endpoints then add this & if you don't want to add
	same security on all then you can create multiple @SecurityScheme and apply it. for example : Basic Authentication, in-memory authentication etc.

-> You can use SecurityScheme annotation for adding security like JWT, OAuth etc : Like below :
	@SecurityScheme(name = "BearerAuth", description = "JWT Auth description", scheme = "bearer", type = SecuritySchemeType.HTTP, bearerFormat = "JWT", in = SecuritySchemeIn.HEADER)
	
-> After adding this hit the swagger-ui, at the right side you will some Authorize button. Click on this and give access token to allow it.

2 : You can add @SecurityRequirement(name = "bearerAuth") at controller level to authenticate each endpoints. It will show you lock on each api.
	You can use it for different-2 role. Like admin, user, teacher etc.

3 : If you want to add lock at your all api's then follow step 1 (openApiDefinitaion) and security here.	
	@OpenAPIDefinition(security = { @SecurityRequirement(name = "bearerAuth") }))
	
4 : Error handling by using Rest with @ControllerAdvice
	To generate documentation automatically, make sure all the methods declare the HTTP Code responses using the annotation: @ResponseStatus
5 : Disabling openAi endpoints 
	If you want to disable openApi endpoints which is by default (/v3/api-docs by default) then use below :
	springdoc.api-docs.enabled=false
	
6 : Disabling swagger-ui
	if you want to disbale swagger-ui and want to implement your own then write below in application.properties
	springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=false
	
------------------------
	Customise Endpoints
------------------------
In this section we will tackle below things related to api :
What this api will do?
Why you created this api?
How many parameters is it taking?
What is the summary? OR Add summary of api and much more.

1 : Go to Controller class and add below tag to make it clear what is controller & add summary of it?
	@Tag(name = "Employee Management", description = "We are creating CURD apps with Spring Boot & taking Employee as a reference")
2 : Add @Operation annotation at api level to add explaination that why you have created, what is the purpose, what is the response and response code etc.
	It comes with many option like : name, description, summary, hidden, method, operationId, response, responseBody, servers, security etc.
	@PostMapping("/save")
	@Operation(description = "Save Employee Data", 
	summary = "We are trying to save employee data one by one into H2 Database.", 
	responses = {
			@ApiResponse(description = "Success",
					responseCode = "200"),
			@ApiResponse(description = "UnAuthorized",
			responseCode = "403")},
	method ="Post",
	deprecated = false,
	parameters = {
			@Parameter(name = "Employee")
	})
	
	@Operation(
			description = "Fetch employee by id",
			summary = "We will make call to h2 db with empId to fetch data record",
			method = "Get",
			parameters = {
					@Parameter(name ="id")
			},
			responses = {
					@ApiResponse(
							description = "Success",
							responseCode = "200"),
					@ApiResponse(
							description = "InternalServer",
							responseCode = "500")
			},
			operationId = "/emp/{id}"
			)

3 : If you don't want to expose any endpoints or controller to the outside world then use below annotation either class lever or api/method level
	@Hidden

------------------------
Migrating from SpringFox
------------------------
1 : If you are using older version of spring boot v<3 and swagger 2 then you need to migrate it to latest versions.
2 : They made lots of changes, Here we will see one by one that how you will migrate it.
3 : Remove springFox and swagger2 dependencies and add webmvc-ui that is below :
	springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui
	
	this started included both hence you don't need to add multiple dependencies.
4 : Replcate swagger2 annotation with swagger 3.
	Note : Don't do that because it is already added in webmvc-ui dependency.
5 : Many tags has been changed. Let's befor and now :

	Before → After 
	@Api → @Tag
	@ApiIgnore → @Parameter(hidden = true) or @Operation(hidden = true) or @Hidden
	@ApiImplicitParam → @Parameter
	@ApiImplicitParams → @Parameters
	@ApiModel → @Schema
	@ApiModelProperty(hidden = true) → @Schema(accessMode = READ_ONLY)
	@ApiModelProperty → @Schema
	@ApiOperation(value = "foo", notes = "bar") → @Operation(summary = "foo", description = "bar")
	@ApiParam → @Parameter
	@ApiResponse(code = 404, message = "foo") → @ApiResponse(responseCode = "404", description = "foo")
	
6 : You also need to create Docket bean as part of swagger2 but with openApi it changed :
	This step is optional: Only if you have multiple Docket beans replace them with GroupedOpenApi beans.
	example :
	
	Before :: 
	@Bean
	public Docket publicApi() {
		return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
				.select()
				.apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage("org.github.springshop.web.public"))
				.paths(PathSelectors.regex("/public.*"))
				.build()
				.groupName("springshop-public")
				.apiInfo(apiInfo());
	}
	
	@Bean
	public Docket adminApi() {
		return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
				.select()
				.apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage("org.github.springshop.web.admin"))
				.paths(PathSelectors.regex("/admin.*"))
				.apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.withMethodAnnotation(Admin.class))
				.build()
				.groupName("springshop-admin")
				.apiInfo(apiInfo());
	}
	
	After :: 
	@Bean
	public GroupedOpenApi publicApi() {
		return GroupedOpenApi.builder()
				.group("springshop-public")
				.pathsToMatch("/public/**")
				.build();
	}
	@Bean
	public GroupedOpenApi adminApi() {
		return GroupedOpenApi.builder()
				.group("springshop-admin")
				.pathsToMatch("/admin/**")
				.addOpenApiMethodFilter(method -> method.isAnnotationPresent(Admin.class))
				.build();
	}

7: If you have only one Docket — remove it and instead add properties to your application.properties:
	springdoc.packagesToScan=package1, package2
	springdoc.pathsToMatch=/v1, /api/balance/**
	
8 : Add bean of OpenAPI type. See example:
	 @Bean
	public OpenAPI springShopOpenAPI() {
		return new OpenAPI()
				.info(new Info().title("SpringShop API")
				.description("Spring shop sample application")
				.version("v0.0.1")
				.license(new License().name("Apache 2.0").url("http://springdoc.org")))
				.externalDocs(new ExternalDocumentation()
				.description("SpringShop Wiki Documentation")
				.url("https://springshop.wiki.github.org/docs"));
	}
